Welcome to the repository for all evaluation sheets related to the 42 school curriculum projects 🎓. These sheets, sourced from the official 42 site, are designed to help students self-evaluate before the real evaluation. They mirror the evaluation that students will receive during the actual project correction, providing a valuable resource for students to succeed on their first attempt 🎯.

For easy access and updates, visit [rphlr.github.io/42-Evals](https://rphlr.github.io/42-Evals/). The HTML versions of the evaluations will be updated progressively. If you wish to contribute an HTML file, kindly fork the repository, place the HTML file in the appropriate folder, and submit a pull request.
